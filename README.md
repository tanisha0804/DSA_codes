# 📚 DSA Codes – Core Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my implementation of core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts, written during my second year of engineering. It includes hands-on coding practice and conceptual understanding of the most fundamental DSA topics — from basic arrays and linked lists to advanced trees and graph algorithms.

The repository is organized topic-wise for easy navigation and revision.

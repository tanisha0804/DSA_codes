LINKED LIST:
list made up of nodes whose memory locations are not continuous or in any sequential order
-> nodes = consists of 2 parts 
		1. data - contains the information
		2. link - contains address of next node of list
			last node always contains NULL in the link as it points to nothing 
			pointer that points to address of first node = head...to access first node of the list and traverse to other nodes by link
1.singly linked list: forward navigation only
2.doubly linked list: forward and backward navigation possible
3.circular linked list: last element linked back to the first element

self referential structure - structure containing a pointer that points to the structure itself
node = a structure which contains 2 different data types in it...a int data and a pointer
